# Analysis of electricity Demand data in Toronto

I took up the publicly available data, by IESO, of electricity demand in Toronto and tried to provide a detailed analysis of various factors affecting it.

When a lockdown was imposed, earlier in 2020, I am sure a lot of us lost the distinction between weekends and weekdays. It was interesting to see this behavior translate into our electricity consumption.

It was also compelling to see the flattening of the peak throughout the eight months of daylight savings time. This is particularly significant from the electricity suppliers' point of view.

I have provided a detailed explanation of the code in the article [here](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/from-lockdown-to-daylight-savings-hidden-insights-from-electricity-demand-data-in-toronto-eff585aada66)
